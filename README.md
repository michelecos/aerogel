# aerogel
aerogel is a very light and solid material, so it makes a good name for a framework based on Google's Material Design Lite collection of styles and Reactions.

This project was meant to be light and simple, making the most of the new ES6 syntax to create a useful set of components speeding up the creation of web applications and Cordova apps. In a way, it was inspired by React.js, but it was based on existing technologies, the ones I already was able to be productive with.

For detailed guidance on how to configure and run Reactions project see [this](https://github.com/michelecos/Reactions/blob/master/README.md).
